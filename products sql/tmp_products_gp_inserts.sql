7 GRAND DAD is a Mario-themed bootleg of the 1991 NES game The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy. It was most likely created by the Taiwanese bootleg publisher J.Y. Company[2] in 1992.

There are very few differences between the two games. The most notable difference is the title screen, which is completely changed. The only parts that remain from the original title screen are the blue background, the salmon font color of the game title, a flashing white text saying "PUSH START BUTTON !", and a picture of Fred Flintstone in a gold star (which was originally a part of the Hanna Barbera Super Stars logo). The title screen music, a remix of "Meet the Flintstones", stays the same as well. The rest is completely changed. The title and logo are replaced with a large salmon "7", a picture of a bootleg Mario recolor (later nicknamed Grand Dad) with the character''s head overlaid by the Fred Flintstone star, and a salmon "GRAND DAD" in a curious square-ish font. The credits at the bottom of the screen are replaced with white text saying "1992 1". The "1", commonly mistaken to be a bootlegger''s nickname, is in fact a level select which can be used by pressing the "Select" button, which causes the number to go up (until 5).[3][4] This level select was implemented by the bootleggers and wasn''t featured in the original game.

During gameplay, the head of Fred Flintstone''s sprite is replaced with the head of Super Mario from Super Mario Bros. 3. However, during cutscenes and the basketball minigame, Fred appears unedited, and he is always called by his real name. Finally, the ending credits are altered to say, "PRESENTED BY XXXXX" instead of "PRESENTED BY TAITO". The rest of the final credits are unchanged.

The game was originally distributed in its own bootleg cart, under the title 原始瑪莉[note 1] VII (GRAND DAD 3M). Later, it was included in a Russian Mario 7-in-1 Dendy multicart, as 7. MARIO 7. ','xbox',0.55,0,0.1,'{"thegamesdb":"122356"}') ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

The Fell Dragon rises! Awaken as the Divine Dragon and fight alongside legendary heroes to save the continent of Eylos in Fire Emblem Engage on Nintendo Switch.\r\n\r\n--> The battle for Elyos begins. Once every 1,000 years, legendary heroes called Emblems grant incredible power to the one who holds the 12 Emblem Rings. As the ritual nears, Alear \u2013 the Divine Dragon of prophecy \u2013 awakens to collect the rings and bring peace to the land. However, Sombron \u2013 the Fell Dragon and ancient nemesis of the Divine Dragon \u2013 has also risen and seeks the rings for his own evil gain. Only Alear and those loyal to the Divine Dragon stand between Sombron and total destruction\u2026\r\n\r\n--> As the wheel turns: command the army of the Divine Dragon through many strategic turn-based battles across the continent of Elyos. Plan your attacks carefully, commanding each hero with their own moves and weapons, to lead them to victory. Each battle is different, requiring its own strategy and approach. Use terrain, positioning and unique talents of your heroes to defeat the enemy across the grid-based battlefield.\r\n\r\n--> Behold, the heroes of legend! Collect Emblem Rings and use them in battle to summon legendary heroes known as Emblems. Each has their own weapons and skills to use, but you can also \u2018engage\u2019 with them to merge and become even more powerful. Assign Emblem Rings to your heroes and let the power of the Emblems flow through them to turn the tide in battle! Heroes can also form bonds with Emblems which, as they improve, give them access to even more abilities.\r\n\r\n--> Know your enemy: in battle, the weapon triangle is all! Each weapon type has an advantage over another: swords over axes, axes over spears and spears over swords. Attack with the right weapon to \u2018break\u2019 an enemy for a turn and prevent them from launching a counterattack. Heroes that use special arts will gain the advantage over opponent with bows, tomes and knives. But be careful! The same rule applies to your troops too, so don\u2019t let the enemy gain an advantage.\r\n\r\n--> Fight your own way: tailor your experience with a range of difficulty and game modes for players of all skill levels. Normal, Hard and Maddening difficulties await, while those looking for a more laid-back experience can even use Auto-Battle to handle combat for them. Casual Mode sees fallen allies revived after a battle, while they\u2019ll be lost forever when using Classic Mode. If you make a major error in combat, just use the Draconic Time Crystal to rewind and try again. It only has limited uses though, so plan carefully!\r\n\r\n--> To the Somniel! Between battles, the Somniel is your home \u2013 a place to interact with your allies and undertake a range of activities. It\u2019s the perfect place to gather your troops before heading out for the next mission. Use the Bulletin Board to invest in neighbouring kingdoms in return for rewards, buy items from the shop, or head to the caf\u00e9 to meet with your fellow heroes. You can also interact with the Emblems you\u2019ve gathered in the Ring Chamber to learn new skills.\r\n\r\n--> A new quest awaits: as you progress through the main story, additional side quests known as Paralogues will become available. These optional missions comes with their own risks, but offer rewards that make them worth your time. Take on as many or as few as you like!\r\n\r\nThe special Fire Emblem Engage: Divine Edition \u2013 including an A1 poster, original soft cover art book, a set of art cards and a SteelBook \u2013 will be available on January 20th, 2023!\r\n\r\nAustralian Classification: M","search_queries":["Fire Emblem Engage"]}},"platforms":["Nintendo Switch"]}','2025-11-04 17:55:57','2025-11-04 19:43:07','835c5fd84d87c36683d9a078f3ae997a578dc21d928f449068eddc77c3952177','In a war against the Fell Dragon, four kingdoms worked together with heroes from other worlds to seal away this great evil.

Luigi is back on a mission to remove a bunch of stubborn ghosts from some super-spooky mansions in Luigi’s Mansion 2 for Nintendo 3DS. Armed with his trusty “Poltergust” ghost-grabbing vacuum cleaner, Mario’s brother takes centre stage to capture those pesky phantoms. Sure, Luigi’s the nervous type who’d rather be as far from these ghosts as he can get, but a reluctant hero can still save the day!

This hair-raising title is the first sequel to the 2002 Nintendo GameCube launch title, Luigi’s Mansion, and brings back all the thrills of the original with bags of new fun features too. The stereoscopic 3D visuals bring the murky mansions, ghastly ghosts and spooky surroundings to life, so you can experience all the haunting chills and supernatural fun the game has to offer.

This time around the ghosts are craftier than ever... Just shining a light on them won’t phase these phantoms; instead you’ll need to shock them with a strobe of light before you can begin to vacuum them up. Incorporating more puzzles than its GameCube predecessor, Luigi’s Mansion 2 will put your grey matter to the test. An array of different ghosts haunt the various mansions, so you’d best get geared-up to help poor scaredy-cat Luigi figure out how to defeat each one!

The old mansions hide secrets aplenty, but that’s just an invitation to exploration for a man armed with a very special vacuum cleaner! On top of hoovering up piles of leaves to reveal hidden hoards or sucking up stacks of cash, the Poltergust can gobble wallpaper and more to reveal secrets, unearth new areas and unveil treasure chests...

And when it''s time for a break from cleaning up ghosts on your own, you can team up with your friends and take on the mighty Scarescraper in Luigi''s Mansion 2''s multiplayer mode. Up for four people can join forces to take on a multi-floored building jam-packed with paranormal creatures, working together to clear each floor before the clock strikes zero. Bonuses and upgrades can be earned depending on how well the team does, while huge boss battles await at the top of the tower. Players can choose the number of floors to play through from five, 10 or 25, adjust the difficulty to cater for both new and veteran gamers, and even revive fallen teammates to keep the adventure going!','nintendo',0.55,0,0.1,'{"thegamesdb":"102233"}') ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario''s head.

"Uwagh, I can''t see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow.

You''ve inherited your grandfather''s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won''t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town''s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness! 

Features 
Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You''ll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. 

Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you''ll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you''ll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. 

Become part of the local community. With over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won''t have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. 

Explore a vast, mysterious cave. As you travel deeper underground, you''ll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. 

Breathe new life into the valley. Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town''s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it''s former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation. 

Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. There are 10 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you''ll have kids and start a family? 

Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. The waters are teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local legend! 

Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum. 

Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out. With over 100 cooking and crafting recipes, you''ll have a wide variety of items to create. Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers, furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium.

Customize the appearance of your character and house. With hundreds of decorative items to choose from, you''ll have no trouble creating the home of your dreams!

Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The U.S. government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world''s remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative \"Bioterrorists \". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Mimicry, allowing him to copy the powers of any Conduit he comes into contact with. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry \"Hank\" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail \"Fetch\" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex-junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video game addict who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.\n\nafter Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, inadvertently absorbing his smoke powers in the process. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or say nothing. Regardless of Delsin''s choice, Augustine knocks him out before moving on to the other tribe members.\n\nDelsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine''s power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine''s powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie''s help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as \"freaks\", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.","rating":77.81291725905405,"aggregated_rating":79.26666666666667,"rating_count":491,"aggregated_rating_count":15,"first_release_date":"2014-03-21","genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/genres\/shooter"},{"id":8,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/genres\/platform"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/genres\/adventure"}],"themes":[],"alternative_names":[],"videos":[],"artworks":[],"screenshots":[],"platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4","slug":"ps4--1","abbreviation":"PS4","alternative_name":"PS4","generation":8,"platform_family":1}],"external_games":[],"characters":[],"websites":[],"collections":[98],"fetched_at":"2025-11-04T19:33:32+00:00"},"platform_rankings":{"ps4":{"rank":9,"platform_label":"PlayStation 4","captured_at":"2025-11-04T19:33:32+00:00"}},"captured_at":"2025-11-04T19:33:32+00:00"}},"platforms":["PlayStation 4"],"genres":["Shooter","Platform","Adventure"],"summary":"Infamous: Second Son, a PlayStation 4 exclusive , brings you an action adventure game where surrounded by a society that fears them, superhumans are ruthlessly hunted down and caged by the Department of Unified Protection.

Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine''s powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie''s help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as \"freaks\", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them."}','2025-11-04 19:33:35','2025-11-04 19:33:35','879427f9c7be3badfdf357f527d0102eb210b88eaf005c1bbdd4e921cecdabfa','Infamous: Second Son, a PlayStation 4 exclusive , brings you an action adventure game where surrounded by a society that fears them, superhumans are ruthlessly hunted down and caged by the Department of Unified Protection.
