The Fell Dragon rises! Awaken as the Divine Dragon and fight alongside legendary heroes to save the continent of Eylos in Fire Emblem Engage on Nintendo Switch.\r\n\r\n--> The battle for Elyos begins. Once every 1,000 years, legendary heroes called Emblems grant incredible power to the one who holds the 12 Emblem Rings. As the ritual nears, Alear \u2013 the Divine Dragon of prophecy \u2013 awakens to collect the rings and bring peace to the land. However, Sombron \u2013 the Fell Dragon and ancient nemesis of the Divine Dragon \u2013 has also risen and seeks the rings for his own evil gain. Only Alear and those loyal to the Divine Dragon stand between Sombron and total destruction\u2026\r\n\r\n--> As the wheel turns: command the army of the Divine Dragon through many strategic turn-based battles across the continent of Elyos. Plan your attacks carefully, commanding each hero with their own moves and weapons, to lead them to victory. Each battle is different, requiring its own strategy and approach. Use terrain, positioning and unique talents of your heroes to defeat the enemy across the grid-based battlefield.\r\n\r\n--> Behold, the heroes of legend! Collect Emblem Rings and use them in battle to summon legendary heroes known as Emblems. Each has their own weapons and skills to use, but you can also \u2018engage\u2019 with them to merge and become even more powerful. Assign Emblem Rings to your heroes and let the power of the Emblems flow through them to turn the tide in battle! Heroes can also form bonds with Emblems which, as they improve, give them access to even more abilities.\r\n\r\n--> Know your enemy: in battle, the weapon triangle is all! Each weapon type has an advantage over another: swords over axes, axes over spears and spears over swords. Attack with the right weapon to \u2018break\u2019 an enemy for a turn and prevent them from launching a counterattack. Heroes that use special arts will gain the advantage over opponent with bows, tomes and knives. But be careful! The same rule applies to your troops too, so don\u2019t let the enemy gain an advantage.\r\n\r\n--> Fight your own way: tailor your experience with a range of difficulty and game modes for players of all skill levels. Normal, Hard and Maddening difficulties await, while those looking for a more laid-back experience can even use Auto-Battle to handle combat for them. Casual Mode sees fallen allies revived after a battle, while they\u2019ll be lost forever when using Classic Mode. If you make a major error in combat, just use the Draconic Time Crystal to rewind and try again. It only has limited uses though, so plan carefully!\r\n\r\n--> To the Somniel! Between battles, the Somniel is your home \u2013 a place to interact with your allies and undertake a range of activities. It\u2019s the perfect place to gather your troops before heading out for the next mission. Use the Bulletin Board to invest in neighbouring kingdoms in return for rewards, buy items from the shop, or head to the caf\u00e9 to meet with your fellow heroes. You can also interact with the Emblems you\u2019ve gathered in the Ring Chamber to learn new skills.\r\n\r\n--> A new quest awaits: as you progress through the main story, additional side quests known as Paralogues will become available. These optional missions comes with their own risks, but offer rewards that make them worth your time.

The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted wasteland. The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren''t happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth''s last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.

Why don''t the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It''s not exactly clear.

So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.','xbox',0.55,0,0.1,'{"thegamesdb":"13148"}') ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
